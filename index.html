    <h2>Trees and Their Importance</h2>
    <h4>October 1, 2023 by Samprati Pandey </h4>

    <article>Trees are God’s greatest gift to life on earth. They give oxygen, food, shelter, and rains. 
        Trees also filter the air and make it clean. Tree roots bind the soil and keep it intact. For birds and animals, a tree is like a house.
        It is like a natural roof overhead. Without trees, birds will be most in danger. They will have no place to nest and lay eggs. Soon all of them will die.
        Animals relax under trees in summer. They also get shelter from the rain. Animals and birds eat the
        fruits of trees. Trees save birds and small animals from predators.  </article>

        <article>Trees help us as long as they live. They also help keep the temperature under control. 
        They help by cooling the air in summer. Elephants and other animals eat the leaves of trees. They are helpful even when they die. 
        Their wood is used to make furniture. It is burned to cook food and get heat. The fallen leaves are very good fertilizer. Trees live for hundreds of years and help us. 
        We must plant as many trees as possible. We must also not damage a tree and let it live.</article>
       
    <h2> The Ocean </h2>
    <h4>October 1, 2023 by National Geographic</h4>
    <img src="istockphoto-1479302862-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Picture of Ocean" height="200px" width="200px">
    <article> The ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. 
        The planet has one global ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. 
        Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers labeled the seas around Antarctica the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic officially recognized this fifth ocean.</article>

        <article>An estimated 97 percent of the world’s water is found in the ocean. Because of this, the ocean has considerable impact on weather, temperature, and the food supply of humans and other organisms. 
        Despite its size and impact on the lives of every organism on Earth, the ocean remains a mystery. More than 80 percent of the ocean has never been mapped, explored, or even seen by humans. 
        A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the moon and the planet Mars has been mapped and studied than of our own ocean floor.</article>
